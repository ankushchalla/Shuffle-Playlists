# Shuffle-Playlists

## Description
Shuffle-Playlists uses the Spotify API to shuffle two playlists selected by the user. Instead of creating a new playlist with songs from both playlists, this web application adds the shuffled songs to the user's queue. A randomly chosen song from one playlist will be followed by a randomly chosen song from the other playlist, and so on.

## Usage
Open the [website](https://stormy-scrubland-36302.herokuapp.com/) on any device. Click the login button, and you will be redirected to the Spotify login page. After successfully logging into your Spotify account, you will be presented with a list of your playlists. After choosing two and clicking the submit button, you will be prompted to choose the number of songs you want to add to queue. After you fill the prompt and click submit, Spotify will add the songs to your queue.
